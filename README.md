🔥 THE ETERNAL FLAME 🔥

I'm thrilled to share my new book - a profound journey through 43 chapters 
exploring life's most important questions:

• What remains when everything is taken away?
• How do we live with presence in an unconscious world?
• What is the flame that cannot be extinguished?

This book was born from real experiences - returning home to an empty room, 
landing a plane without memory, watching time pass and transform everyone 
around us.

It's about awakening to the truth that most people never see.

✨ Living with Presence
✨ The Passing of Time
✨ The Human Mind Under Fire
✨ Silent Observation
✨ What We Cannot Control
